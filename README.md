input-placeholder
=================

Yet another HTML5 placeholder shim plugin.

There are a [ton of plugins](http://www.quora.com/JavaScript/Which-plugin-to-use-for-HTML5-placeholder-that-retains-the-label-on-focus) trying to emulate HTML5's placeholder attribute. This is yet another one.

Key features:

1. Does not delete a field's content when focused.
2. No messy CSS tricks required.

See [this fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/ripper234/zSxjw/2/).

Cons:

1. Immature
2. Doesn't use the placeholder attribute/syntax, but rather uses the value attribute.

Usage:

&lt;<input name='email' value='Email Address'&gt;
